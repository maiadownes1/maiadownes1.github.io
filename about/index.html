        My name is Maia Downes and I was born in Chicago Illinios on September 24<sup>th</sup>, 2003. I live in Old Irving Park. 
        <p>    
        I went to St. Viator elementry for grade school. My favorite childhood memory is probably when I got my first bike. But I was pretty busy when I was younger because my parents wanted me to find something that I like to do so they signed me up for everything. It feels like I played every sport. I don't remember a lot from when I was younger but I remember that I liked to draw and that I would read a lot of medical books and greek mythology.
        <p>   
        The classes I take at school are P.E., English I, Geometry, Biology, World Studies, Spanish, and Computer Science. My least favorite class is probably English because I get a lot of homework so I don't have a lot of time to do clubs or hang out with friends. I am in Best Buddies and yearbook and I am currently on the JV basketball team.
        <p>
        I want to go to Michigan State for college and I want to become a dermatologist. I hope I can get a scholarship for college so I don't have to pay a lot of student loans, and I hope to one day live in Flordia because I hate cold weather.
